stopwords = pd.read_csv('./material/SpanishStopWords.csv', encoding = "ISO-8859-1")
stopwords = [s[0] for s in stopwords.values.tolist()]
q6 = [s for s in stopwords if s in txt]

    
 7. For each stop word, on a web page, please show the word before that word and the following word,
    in the Alamo story.
    Then remove all stop words (not the others) and show remaining text.

word_tokens = word_tokenize(txt)
txt_list = [w for w in word_tokens] 
# txt_list = txt.split(' ')
q7 = [(txt_list[i-1], txt_list[i+1]) for i, w in enumerate(txt_list) if w in stopwords]


 8. Please show the N least frequent words in the story, ordered by frequency, where we will give you N.

def search_largest_n(number=5):
    freq = request.args.get('freq')
    word = request.args.get('word')
    ansd = []
    ansc = []
    if freq:
      counter = Counter(txt_list)
      for k, v in counter.items():
          freq = int(freq)
          if freq>0:
            ansc.append([k, v])
          freq -= 1
      print("dda", ansc)
    if word:
      sentence_list = txt.split('.')
      
      for sentence in sentence_list:
          if word in sentence:
              ansd.append(sentence_list)
      print('aad', ansd)
      
    return render_template('large_n.html', ci=ansc, di=ansd)


 9. Please show any sentences where any date (number) appears.

      ans = []	
      for sentence in sentence_list:
          for word in sentence:
              if word.isnumber():
                   ans.append(sentence)


 10. We will give you a word (name) on a web page. Please show us all sentences that have that word.

def search_largest_n(number=5):
    freq = request.args.get('freq')
    word = request.args.get('word')
    ansd = []
    ansc = []
    if freq:
      counter = Counter(txt_list)
      for k, v in counter.items():
          freq = int(freq)
          if freq>0:
            ansc.append([k, v])
          freq -= 1
      print("dda", ansc)
    if word:
      sentence_list = txt.split('.')
      
      for sentence in sentence_list:
          if word in sentence:
              ansd.append(sentence_list)
      print('aad', ansd)
      
    return render_template('large_n.html', ci=ansc, di=ansd)
